# A_raylib_test_with_my_API_design <br>
HOW TO USE: <br>
pls read the module_app_core.h, all the func you can use is in there, which is not finished, still on the way getting all the useful func in raylib.h and convert in to my version. <br>
<br>
HOW TO BUILD: <br>
linux only: <br>
download the folder, run ./compile.sh in terminal (remember to chmod +x ./compile.sh first), it will output a main, run by ./main in terminal. <br>
<br>
NOTE ON SOME CONVENTION: <br>
most draw img/box/shape is drawed from bottom left, instead of those graphic lib top left, reason being this is the logical way as it is close to how 2D/3D coordinate physic system work.
